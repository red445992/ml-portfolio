# Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning tasks are well defined and can be used in multiple tasks like detecting spam email or predicting percipitation. Supervised learning make decision after training in vast amount of true data and then making connections between the data to predict the right results.

Supervised learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled dataset to train algorithms and predict outcomes and recognize patterns.
It invovles training a model on labeled data to learn patterns and relationships which it then uses to make accurate predictions on new data.

Supervised learning algorithm are given labeled training to learn the relationship between input and output.
eg: image classification, fraud detection, recommendations systems etc. 

Supervised learning is based on following core concepts:
i. Data
ii. Model
iii. Training
iv. Evalutaing
v. Inference


There are two types of Supervised Learning:
 i. Regression
 ii. Classification
