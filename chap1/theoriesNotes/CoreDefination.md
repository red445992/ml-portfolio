## Machine Learning Defination:
Machine learning is a process of training a piece of software called model to make useful prediction and generating contents like image,text,voice, videos etc from data.

for example: if we have to predict weather forcasting we could use either traditional approach or the machine learning approach. 
In traditional approach, we have to sit and use study about atmosphere and complex mathematical equations, we have to use physics based representation which is very hard and very difficult. On other hand we have Machine Learning approach where we train an model with enormous amount of data until ML model eventually learn the mathematical relationship between weather patterns that can produce differing weather patterns. It would automatically predict the weather for the coming days based on the today weather pattern.
