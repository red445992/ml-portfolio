## Machine Learning Defination:
Machine learning is a process of training a piece of software called model to make useful prediction and generating contents like image,text,voice, videos etc from data.

for example: if we have to predict weather forcasting we could use either traditional approach or the machine learning approach. 
In traditional approach, we have to sit and use study about atmosphere and complex mathematical equations, we have to use physics based representation which is very hard and very difficult. On other hand we have Machine Learning approach where we train an model with enormous amount of data until ML model eventually learn the mathematical relationship between weather patterns that can produce differing weather patterns. It would automatically predict the weather for the coming days based on the today weather pattern.

## Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning system can fall under one or more of the following category according to they way they make predections or generate content:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Generative AI

# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a process of training a model with a large set of datas with correct answers and then model itself make connections between elements in the data to produce the correct answer. It is like student preparing for upcoming exams by learning from multiples old question bank with both question and correct answers. After learning from multiple question sets they are ready for the next exams. 

There are two types of supervies learning: Regression and classification
i. Regression: Regression are used to make prediction and give answers in numeric value. For example model calculating the amount of rainfall based on different known parameters like humidity, atmosphere etc is a regression model. 
 Further See the table below to see more examples of Regression: 
 |Scenario | Possible Input Data | Output |
 |Future House Price | square foot, no of bedrooms, location, constructions costs, property tax, morgae tax etc | The price of a home|

 ii. Classification: Classification predicts the likelihood that something belongs to a category or not. Unlike regression model whose output is a numeric value, classification gives output either 0 (false) or 1 (True). For example classification helps to classify whether a mail is spam or not. 
 There are also two typess of classification : Binary Classification, Multiclass classification. Lets Understand it as: There is a model which predicts rainfall based on the given inputs. With binary classification the model predicts either it rains or no rain. Basically a yes or no statement. But with Multi class classification model can predicts either rain, hail or snow basically multiple possibilities.
